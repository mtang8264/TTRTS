# TTRTS - Tabletop Real Time Strategy

This project is envisioned as a tabletop/board game version of real time strategy games. You and a group of friends are members of a great empire in the far flung future and have been sent to a hostile planet to bend it to your wills.

**Explore** the dangerous and resource-rich landscapes.

**Build** great works of technology to control your surroundings.

**Research** new ways to bring glory to the empire.

**Destroy** all who stand in your way.
